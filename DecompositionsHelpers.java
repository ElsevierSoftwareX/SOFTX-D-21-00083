   * Method, using blocks from blanket B, finds the minimal blanket Q, which fulfils the relation A x Q &lt;= F.
   *
   * Algorithm:
   * 1. Block in blanket A should be sorted for synthesis process (blanket class has a proper function, which does it).
   * 2. The process starting from the last block of blanket A (it should be the greatest) - technically the largest blocks
   *    is hard to join with other ones, thus they should be processed as first.
   * 3. For selected block from blanket A (blockA) one of blocks from blanket B (blockB) was chosen (iterating through blocks from blanket B).
   *    If (blockA x blockB &lt;= F) then the next blocks from blanket B will be checked - blockB will be summed with the next blocks from blanket B.
   *    This process lasts until relation (blockA * (blockB(n) + blockB(n+1)...) &gt; F) if fulfilled. The last sum of blocks (blockB(n) + blockB(n+1)...),
   *    which fulfills the relation (blockA * (blockB(n) + blockB(n+1)...) &lt;= F) is the proper result for the given step of process.
   * 4. Algorithm ends when all blocks of blanket B was used.
   *
   * @param A blanket, the first parameter
   * @param B blanket from which blocks should be used to construct the blanket Q
   * @param F blanket, the third parameter
   * @return minimal blanket Q, which fulfills relation (A x Q &lt;= F)
